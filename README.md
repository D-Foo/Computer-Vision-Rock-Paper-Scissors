# Example Project Documentation Guideline

> A small project exploring the possible applications of Google's [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) by combining it with a rock paper scissors game written while learning python.
> 
> Made with [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/learn) and [OpenCv](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/)

## Creating the Model

- Created a model using Teachable Machine by posing in front of the camera in rock paper scissors poses and a neutral pose for an option for no input.

## Setting up the environment

Created a conda environment for the project then downloaded and installed TensorFlow and OpenCv libraries. 

```bash
conda create --name tensorflow-env
conda activate tensorflow-env
conda install tensorflow
conda install opencv
```

- Tensorflow is used to load and use the model made from Teachable Machine

```python
"""Insert your code here"""
```

> Insert screenshot of what you have built working.

## Milestone n

- Continue this process for every milestone, making sure to display clear understanding of each task and the concepts behind them as well as understanding of the technologies used.

- Also don't forget to include code snippets and screenshots of the system you are building, it gives proof as well as it being an easy way to evidence your experience!

## Conclusions

- Maybe write a conclusion to the project, what you understood about it and also how you would improve it or take it further.

- Read through your documentation, do you understand everything you've written? Is everything clear and cohesive?
